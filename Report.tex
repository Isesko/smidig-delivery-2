\section{Sprint Goal}
We had the goal of making a functional application, with navigational options, that we could use as 
a base for the next sprint by the end of this week. \break
$\-$ The result of this week was a functional app, where you can navigate several pages. 
It is not the best looking, but is a good base to continue our work with. It has low cost and 

\section{Backlog}
This is the current backlog for thie project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text input component is a work in progress.
    \item Login modal missing integration with project.
    \item Hypothetical reports on what can go wrong and access control solutions.
    \item React routing.

\section{Reflection}
This section will anwser the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Could you have done anything differently?
    \item What were you particularly satisfied with?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Could you have done anything differently?}
Improving our team communication and collabaration could have improved our workflow a lot. Ensuring that everyone was on the 
same page when starting production of our application. We should've had a more refined sketch done beforehand to improve 
clarity and end goal.

\subsection{What were you particularly satisfied with?}
We achieved our goal of developing a functional application, which will serve as a foundation for the next week's sprint. 
This weeks work provides us with a solid, low cost base which we can utilize to its fullest to continue our development.

\section{Introduction}
This report aims to document our groups experiences with the groups first design sprint.
We will be covering the following topics:

\section{Technical background}
\subsection{Agile development}
\subsection{Scrum}
\subsubsection{Scrumwise}
\subsubsection{Scrum master}
\subsection{Development sprint}
\subsection{Backlog}
\subsection{ReactJS}
\subsubsection{Component based development}
\subsection{Vite}


\section{Sprint Goal}
We had the goal of making a functional application, with navigational options, that we could use as 
a base for the next sprint by the end of this week. \break
$\-$ The result of this week was a functional app, where you can navigate several pages. 
It is not the best looking, but is a good base to continue our work with. It has low cost and 

\section{Backlog}
This is the current backlog for thie project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text input component is a work in progress.
    \item Login modal missing integration with project.
    \item Hypothetical reports on what can go wrong and access control solutions.
    \item React routing.
    \item Create Image slideshow component.
\end{itemize}
We also had a password strenght checker planned as an optional task if we had the time.

\subsubsection{Joar Heimonen}
[Insert text here]
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a ReadMe file for GitHub
        \item Selected an open source license
        \item Created a basic layout using either css-grid or flexboxes
        \item Created different layout components
        \item Added example pages
        \item Refactored Navigation bar
        \item Created a slideshow component
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Iselin Skorpen}
Iselin made the Logo and created a mockup of the design and layout of the home page. This was to get a feel for how the website was 
going to look and function for future creation. The start of the Navigation bar was made by Iselin. This report was also written by 
Iselin as well as Joar.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a logo.
        \item Created a mockup of the home page.
        \item Created a mockup of the navigation bar.
        \item Created the Navigation bar.
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Salim Said}
Salin partially a Text input component and a login modal. This needs integration into the application to function with everything 
else. He also wrote a document that "defines security practices and standards that will guide the development process".

\section{Reflection}
This section will anwser the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Could you have done anything differently?
    \item What were you particularly satisfied with?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Could you have done anything differently?}
Improving our team communication and collabaration could have improved our workflow a lot. Ensuring that everyone was on the 
same page when starting production of our application. We should've had a more refined sketch done beforehand to improve 
clarity and end goal.

\subsection{What were you particularly satisfied with?}
We achieved our goal of developing a functional application, which will serve as a foundation for the next week's sprint. 
This weeks work provides us with a solid, low cost base which we can utilize to its fullest to continue our development.

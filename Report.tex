\section{Introduction}
This report aims to document our groups experiences with the groups first design sprint.
We will be covering the following topics:

\section{Technical background}
This section aims to describe the following terms:
\subsection{Agile development\cite{AgileSoftwareDevelopment2024}}
Agile software development is software that is developed according to the ideas and values presented in the 
Manifesto for Agile Software Development\cite{ManifestoAgileSoftware}.
The manifesto presents the following core ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    \item Working software over comprehensive documentation
    \item Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    \item Responding to change over following a plan
\end{itemize}
The manifesto is based on ideas created by the Agile Alliance in 2001, 
this is a group of 17 software developers.
\subsubsection{Scrum\cite{Scrum2023}}
Scrum is a type of agile methodology. The methodology was created in 1986 and widely popuralized 
after the manifesto for agile software development was published.
\subsubsection{Scrumwise\cite{scrumwiseScrumToolsScrum}}
Scrumwise is a service for managing a scrumboard. Scrumwise claims it is "The easiest Scrum tool you'll find", 
while this has not been substansiated in any meaningfull way the tool is used by many.
\subsubsection{Scrum master}
The leader of a scrum project is often refered to as the scrum master.
It is the scrum masters task to remove obstacles and streamline the teams development processes.
\subsection{Development sprint\cite{Timeboxing2024}}
A development sprint, also known as a Timebox is the process of allocating a time constraint to
reach a goal. These time constraints usually consists of a week to a month of time.
Timeboxes are great for mitigating risk as per Parkinson's law\cite{ParkinsonLaw2024}
\subsection{Backlog\cite{Backlog2022}}
A backlog usually refers to an accumulation of unfinished work.
\subsection{React\cite{React}}
React is JS\cite{ECMA262} framework for component based development of websites.
\subsubsection{Component based development\cite*{ComponentbasedSoftwareEngineering2024}}
Component based development also known as Component based software engineering is a method of software development
that aims for components of software to be loosely coupled and reusable. Component based development is an 
essential part of any agile workflow.
\subsection{Vite\cite{Vite}}
Vite is a local development server aimed at developing web applications.

\section{Sprint Goal}
We had the goal of making a functional application, with navigational options, that we could use as 
a base for the next sprint by the end of this week. \break
$\-$ The result of this week was a functional app, where you can navigate several pages. 
It is not the best looking, but is a good base to continue our work with. It has low cost and 

\section{Backlog}
This is the current backlog for thie project.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Text input component is a work in progress.
    \item Login modal missing integration with project.
    \item Hypothetical reports on what can go wrong and access control solutions.
    \item React routing.
    \item Create Image slideshow component.
\end{itemize}
We also had a password strenght checker planned as an optional task if we had the time.

\section{Reflection}
This section will anwser the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Could you have done anything differently?
    \item What were you particularly satisfied with?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Could you have done anything differently?}
Improving our team communication and collabaration could have improved our workflow a lot. Ensuring that everyone was on the 
same page when starting production of our application. We should've had a more refined sketch done beforehand to improve 
clarity and end goal.

\subsection{What were you particularly satisfied with?}
We achieved our goal of developing a functional application, which will serve as a foundation for the next week's sprint. 
This weeks work provides us with a solid, low cost base which we can utilize to its fullest to continue our development.
